About the data
- The data is captured from a micro-milling process. The data consists of data pertaining to machining as well as non-machining time.
- The data consists of 4 columns, 1)time (s), 2) Fx- Force in x direction, 3) Fy- Force in y-direction, 4) Fz- Force in z-direction. All the forces are measured in N.

Goal
- You are to apply k-means clustering algorithm to identify the start and end of machining from this data.
What is to be submitted?
- You are to submit the .ipynb file which contains your code and .pdf file which conatins the approach you have adopted to solve this problem.

- The start and end time of machining should be displayed in the code and it has to be reported in the pdf file.
